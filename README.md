# **This project has moved**

The `pi-carplay` repository is now maintained under the new name **LIVI**.

**New home:**  
https://github.com/f-io/LIVI

## Why?
The project outgrew its original Raspberry Pi–focused scope and has evolved into
a more general **L**inux **I**n-**V**ehicle **I**nfotainment (LIVI) head unit software.
